# Deep-Learning-Car-Brand
# Step 1: Clone the Project
Clone the project repository into your local environment using Visual Studio Code or your preferred version control tool. Ensure you have both the dataset and the app.py file. Train the machine learning model as demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook and save it as a pickle file for later use.

# Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open the Anaconda prompt and navigate to the directory where you've stored the project files using the cd (change directory) and ls (list files) commands. This ensures that you are in the correct working directory.

cd /path/to/your/project

# Step 3: Run the Flask App
Execute the Flask web application by running the following command:

python app.py

Upon running this command, a link should appear at the bottom of the Anaconda prompt, indicating that the Flask app is running. Open this link in a web browser, and you're all set to use the Car Brand Classifier. You can now upload car images to get instant brand identifications.

Please make sure to follow any additional instructions provided in the project's README file and ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed in your Anaconda environment. This streamlined process allows you to effortlessly run and interact with the innovative Car Brand Classifier project.
